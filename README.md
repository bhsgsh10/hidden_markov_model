# hidden_markov_model
 This project implements the Forward Algorithm and the Viterbi Algorithm in Python. It also trains a new model for better  accuracy results in HMM.   
`normalize()` and testing functions were already provided. Other functions are my work.   
 Commands for running the project are as follows:   
```python hmm.py weather_model.txt weather_dataset.txt``` to use the weather model and dataset.   
```python hmm.py typo_model.txt typo_dataset.txt``` to use the Unabomber manifesto model and dataset.   
 Use the following command to train a new model:   
 ```python hmm.py -t new_model.txt typo_data_training.txt```
