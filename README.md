    This project implements the Forward Algorithm and the Viterbi Algorithm in Python. It also trains a new model for better  accuracy results in HMM. <br/>
`normalize()` and testing functions were already provided. Other functions are my work.<br/>
 Commands for running the project are as follows: <br/>
`python hmm.py weather_model.txt weather_dataset.txt` to use the weather model and dataset <br/>
`python hmm.py typo_model.txt typo_dataset.txt` to use the Unabomber manifesto model and dataset <br/>
    Use the following command to train a new model: <br/>
    `python hmm.py -t new_model.txt typo_data_training.txt`
